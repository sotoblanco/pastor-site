I'm a Machine Learning Engineer who loves building data-science infrastructure  and developer tools 👷🏼‍♂️.  I've recently caught the entrepreneurship bug and am building something new with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/).  I have previously held related roles at Airbnb, DataRobot, and GitHub, as well as a long stint in management consulting.

I'm also very active in open source, write blog posts and give talks.
