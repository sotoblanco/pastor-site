Hello, I'm Hamel Husain. I'm a machine learning engineer who loves building machine learning infrastructure and tools 👷🏼‍♂️.  I lead or contribute to many popular [open-source machine learning projects](oss/opensource.qmd). Furthermore, I have extensive experience (20+ years) as a machine learning engineer [across various industries](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamelhusain/), including large tech companies like Airbnb and GitHub.
:::

I'm currently an [independent consultant](./hire.qmd) helping companies operationalize LLMs. At GitHub, I lead [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet), a large language model for semantic search that was a precursor to [CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), a large language model used by millions of developers.

## 💼 Get In Touch

Do you need help operationalizing ML or large language models?  

I'm open to consulting work and other forms of advisory. Email me at `hamel@parlance-labs.com` if you'd like to chat!
