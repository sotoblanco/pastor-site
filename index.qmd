Hello, I'm Hamel Husain. I'm a machine learning engineer who loves building data-science and developer tools 👷🏼‍♂️.  I've recently caught the entrepreneurship bug and am incubating something new.  I have previously worked at Airbnb, DataRobot, and GitHub, as well as a long stint in management consulting.

:::

I am a core developer for [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/). I've also contributed to many open source ML/data tools, which [I've listed here](oss/opensource.qmd).

## 💼 Get In Touch

Do you need help operationalizing ML, or with any of the [open source projects](oss/opensource.qmd) I'm involved with?  I'm open to consulting work and other forms of advisory. 

Email me at `hamel.husain@gmail.com`, or DM me on [![](icon-linkedin.png){width="3%"}](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamelhusain/) or [![](icons-twitter.png){width="3%"}](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain) if you'd like to chat!
