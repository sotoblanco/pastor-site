![](hamel_transparent.png){.profile-pic}

I am a machine learning engineer with over 20 years of [experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamelhusain/). I have worked with innovative companies such as Airbnb and GitHub, which included [early LLM research used by OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-text-and-code-embeddings#:~:text=We%20evaluate%20the%20code%20search%20models%20on%20the%C2%A0CodeSearchNet%C2%A0(Husain%20et%20al.%2C%202019)) for code understanding. I have also led and contributed to numerous popular [open-source machine-learning tools](oss/opensource.qmd). I am currently an independent consultant helping companies operationalize Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate their AI product journey.
