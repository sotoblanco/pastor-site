## About

Hi, I am Hamel Husain. As a machine learning engineer with over 20 years of experience, I have worked with innovative companies such as Airbnb and GitHub and led and contributed to numerous popular [open-source machine-learning tools](oss/opensource.qmd). I am currently an independent consultant helping companies operationalize Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate their AI product journey. You can read more about my experience [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamelhusain/).

You should consider hiring me if ...

-   You don’t know how to improve your LLM products replicably.
-   Your LLMs need to be cheaper or faster.
-   You are overwhelmed by tools & frameworks.
-   Feel lost on what to do next with your LLM products.
-   Need outside expertise to evaluate your needs and vet potential talent.

## What I can do for you.

-   **Build domain-specific evaluation systems:** Measure the performance and reliability of your LLMs with custom evaluation systems tailored to your domain.
-   **Fine-tune models:** Optimize your LLMs for efficiency and accuracy to enhance the performance of your products.
-   **Create development tools and infrastructure:** Streamline your AI development process with custom-built tools and infrastructure, enabling rapid iteration on LLMs.
-   **Product strategy:** I can guide you on what to build, how to build it, and what to prioritize. I can also assist with hiring by evaluating your business’ needs and vetting potential talent.
-   **Content and writing:** Make your AI solutions understandable to users and stakeholders.

If you have experienced any of these problems and are looking for help solving them, send me a brief email at `hamel@parlance-labs.com` about your project’s needs.

## Services

I offer two tiers of services to support your goals.

I'll give you a detailed plan and help you stay on track via regular meetings with your team. This is designed to help you save enormous amounts of time and money by avoiding common pitfalls and selecting the right tools and techniques.

### Tier 2: Comprehensive

Everything in Tier 1, plus:

-   Implementation: I'll write production-ready code and/or prototypes to accelerate your AI product development.
-   Hands-On Model Optimization: I’ll fine-tune, prompt engineer and debug models to improve performance and efficiency.
