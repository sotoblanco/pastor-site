# Hire Me

You should consider hiring me if:

- You donâ€™t know how to consistently and quickly improve your LLM products.
- Your LLMs are too expensive or slow.
- You feel blind re: how good/reliable your LLMs are.
- You are overwhelmed by tools/frameworks.

# What I can do for you

I am skilled in the following areas:

1. Building domain-specific evaluation systems
2. Fine-tuning models
3. Creating dev tools and infrastructure to help you iterate quickly on LLMs
4. Product strategy, including hiring
5. Content and writing

# Contact

I am an independent consultant and am available for hire.  You can reach me at `hamel@parlance-labs.com`.  I do both short-term and long-term engagements on a retainer or hourly basis, depending on the situation.

# Current & Past Clients

As an independent consultant, I have had the privilege of working with the most innovative companies in the space.  Before becoming an independent consultant, I worked in the industry for over 20 years, including GitHub, where I led research on LLMs that was a precursor to GitHub Copilot.
