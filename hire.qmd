# Hire Me

You should consider hiring me if:

- You donâ€™t know how to consistently and quickly improve your LLM products.
- Your LLMs are too expensive or slow.
- You feel blind re: how good/reliable your LLMs are.
- You are overwhelmed by tools/frameworks.

# What I can do for you

I am skilled in the following areas:

1. Building domain-specific evaluation systems
2. Fine-tuning models
3. Creating dev tools and infrastructure to help you iterate quickly on LLMs
4. LLM vendor evaluation and selection
5. Product strategy, including hiring
6. Content and writing

# Contact

I am currently an independent consultant and am available for hire.  You can reach me at `hamel@parlance-labs.com`.  I do both short-term and long-term engagements on a retainer or hourly basis, depending on the situation.

# Will you be my employee?

My clients include vendors, startups, and commercially-backed open source projects in the LLM space - which I often coordinate for the benefit of everyone.  For example, I have helped LLM vendors get their first customers, and startups put their first models into production with the support of these vendors and open-source projects.  I also have a strong network and can help you hire.

I greatly enjoy working across the ecosystem to bring unique value to my clients, which would be hard to continue to do as a full-time employee.
