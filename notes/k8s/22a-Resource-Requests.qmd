Example of container resource requests:


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: images.my-company.example/app:v4
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
  - name: log-aggregator
    image: images.my-company.example/log-aggregator:v6
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

Also see [Resource limits](22-Resource-Limits.qmd), and [these docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/.)

## GPUs

GPUs are only supposed to be specified in the limits section, which means:

- You can specify GPU limits without specifying `requests`, because Kubernetes will use the limit as the request value by default.
- You can specify GPU in both `limits` and `requests` but these two values must be equal.
- You cannot specify GPU `requests` without specifying `limits`.

Here's an example manifest for a Pod that requests a GPU:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-vector-add
spec:
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
  containers:
    - name: example-vector-add
      image: "registry.example/example-vector-add:v42"
      resources:
        limits:
          gpu-vendor.example/example-gpu: 1 # requesting 1 GPU
```
