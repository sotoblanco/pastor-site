This is general advice that's resonated with me from books about independent consulting.

-   Don't sell work by the hour that isn't tied to results. This is what everyone else is doing and leads to bad offers. People should be buying results, not time. This must be coupled with charging more. [^1]
    -   I find this particularly hard to do because results for AI projects are often hard to predict and have long time horizons.
-   Find the right market (starving crowd + purchasing power): don't sell to series A startups.
-   Niche down: "AI for Private Equity"
-   If you are competing on price that is a smell that your offer is bad.
-   Process: Goals -> Problems -> Solutions.
    -   Create a list of solutions by appending "How To" to the problems.
-   Offer: Solutions -> Delivery -> Filter & Bundle
    - Delivery: ex: Excel spreadsheet, 1:1 coaching, online course, etc.
    Filter: axe low-value, low-cost or low-value, high-cost items.  You are left with high-value low-cost and high-value high-cost items.  
    - Bundle: Sexier name for a group of solutions -> "Foolproof Bargain Grocery System"
