title: Merge listings
description: Merge listings from multiple sources
---


You can now merge listings by referencing multiple directories or files in the front matter.  This allows you to create a single listing of all your _external_ blogs you may write on other platforms, Medium, substack, your work blog, etc, with your own blogs.  

The kind folks at Quarto have made an update in their latest [pre-release](https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html) that allows you to merge multiple listings like this:

```yaml
listing:
  contents: [blog_data/blogs.yml, blog/posts]
```

The `blog_data/blogs.yml` is a [listing from data](listings-from-data.qmd) while `blog/posts` is a [Quarto posts directory](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#posts-directory) of blog posts.

See [source code for my blog](https://github.com/hamelsmu/hamel/blob/master/index.qmd) for an example.
