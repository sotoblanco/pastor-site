You don't need to have blog posts to create a [listing](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) on a Quarto page.  For example, you can combine the following three yaml files:


```{.yaml filename="blog/_metadata.yml"}
listing: 
  max-description-length: 75
  date-format: short
  feed: true
  filter-ui: false
  type: table
  sort-ui: false
  sort: "date desc"
  categories: false
  fields: [date, name]
  field-links: [name]
  field-display-names:
    name: Title
format:
  html:
    anchor-sections: true
```

This file specifies a list of blog posts that you can have elsewhere

```{.yaml filename="blog/blogs.yml"}
- name: "nbdev + Quarto: A new secret weapon for productivity"
  path: https://www.fast.ai/2022/07/28/nbdev-v2/
  date: 2022-07-28
  categories: [Jupyter, Quarto, nbdev]
  description: |
    Our favorite tool for software engineering productivityâ€“nbdev, now re-written with Quarto.

- name: Notebooks in production with Metaflow
  path: https://outerbounds.com/blog/notebooks-in-production-with-metaflow/
  date: 2022-02-09
  categories: [Metaflow, Jupyter]
  description: |
   Introduces a new Metaflow feature that allows users to use notebooks in production ML workflows.
```

In the front matter of any page (like `index.qmd`) you can reference `blogs.yml` and `_metadata.yml` like so:


```{.markdown filename="index.qmd"}
---
sidebar: false
description: "A collection of technical blogs and talks on machine learning and data science."
toc: true
metadata-files: 
  - blog/_metadata.yml
listing: 
  id: blog-listings
  contents: blog/blogs.yml
---

## Reference the listing somewhere on the page like this

Subscribe via RSS: [<i class="bi bi-rss"></i>](index.xml)

::: {#blog-listings}
:::
```

:::{.callout-tip}
# Overriding YAML configurations

You can override any option specified in `metadata.yml` by setting that after `metadata-files`.  Things that come later in the front-matter will override any inherited files.
:::

## Results

This will generate a list of blog posts that you can see here on [my page](https://hamel.dev), this is in the `table` format.  However, you can have pictures on your listing as well, which you can see from the Minimal Example.

## Minimal Example

Here is a [minimal example](https://hamelsmu.github.io/minimal-site/) of creating an index page of all your blog posts. It uses slightly different options than I did in the above example. You can see the code for [that here](https://github.com/hamelsmu/minimal-site).
