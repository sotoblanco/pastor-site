My open-source work has been focused on developer tools and infrastructure. I've contributed to projects such as [fastai](#fastai), [Metaflow](#metaflow), [Kubeflow](#kubeflow), [Jupyter](#jupyter), and [Great Expectations](#great-expectations), as well as [many others](#other).  I list some of these below:

<br>

## ![](img_oss/axolotl.png){width="8%"} Axolotl 

I am a core contributor to [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl), a library for efficient fine-tuning of large language models. I also wrote an in-depth [debugging guide](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/axolotl/) for Axolotl.

## ![](img_oss/fastai_small.png){width="10%"} fastai 

I maintain and contribute to a variety of [fastai](https://github.com/fastai) projects. Below are the projects I've been very involved in:

## ![](img_oss/metaflow.webp){width="7%"} Metaflow

I created [notebook cards](https://github.com/outerbounds/metaflow-card-notebook): A tool that allows you to use notebooks to generate reports, visualizations and diagnostics in Metaflow production workflows. [Blog](https://outerbounds.com/blog/notebooks-in-production-with-metaflow/)

## ![](img_oss/kubeflow.jpeg){width="10%"} Kubeflow

I've worked on several projects related to Kubeflow, mainly around examples and documentation:

## ![](img_oss/jupyter.png){width="7%"} Jupyter

I created the [Repo2Docker GitHub Action](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action), which allows you to trigger [repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker) to build a Jupyter enabled Docker images from your GitHub repository.  This Action allows you to pre-cache images for your own [BinderHub cluster](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zero-to-binderhub/setup-binderhub.html) or for [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).

This project was accepted into the official JupyterHub GitHub org.

## ![](img_oss/ge-logo.png){width="7%"} Great Expectations

I developed the [Great Expectations GitHub Action](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations_action) that allows you to use Great Expectations in CI/CD Workflows. [Blog](https://github.blog/2020-10-01-keeping-your-data-pipelines-healthy-with-the-great-expectations-github-action/).


## <i class="bi bi-github"></i> Other

I worked as a staff machine learning engineer at GitHub from 2017 - 2022.  I led or created the following open source projects that explored the intersection of machine learning, data and the developer workflow:
