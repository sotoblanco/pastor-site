People often find me through my writing on AI and tech. This creates an interesting pattern. Nearly every week, vendors reach out asking me to write about their products. While I appreciate their interest and love learning about new tools, I reserve my writing for topics that I have personal experience with.

One conversation last week really stuck with me. A founder confided, "We can write the best content in the world, but we don't have any distribution." This hit home because I used to think the same way. Many companies feel this pain. They've built something valuable and want the world to know it.

Many companies are skipping the basics in their search for marketing shortcuts. Let me share what works for reaching developers. These are proven approaches I've seen succeed, both in my work and in others' efforts to grow their audience in the AI space.

## 1. Build on Great Work

Here's something surprising:  few people take the time to thoughtfully engage with others' work in our field. But when you do, amazing things happen naturally.

For example, if you make AI evaluation tools, you could write about:

- Shreya Shankar's [DocETL](https://data-people-group.github.io/blogs/2024/09/24/docetl/)

- Eugene Yan's work on [AlignEval](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/aligneval/)

Share how their ideas connect with what you've seen work for your customers. Add your case studies and real-world insights. If you deeply engage with someone's work and add your insights, they often share your content with their audience. Not because you asked, but because you've added something meaningful to their work.

The key is authenticity. Don't do this just for marketingâ€”do it because you're genuinely interested in learning from others and building on their ideas. The beautiful thing is, in tech, especially AI, there's so much fascinating work. It's not hard to find things to be excited about. I'm amazed by how few people take this approach. It's both effective and fun.

## 2. Show Up Consistently

I see too many companies blogging or posting once every few months and wondering why they're not getting traction. Want to know what actually works? Look at [Jason Liu](https://x.com/jxnlco). He grew his following from 500 to 30,000 followers by posting 6-7 times every day for a year.

You don't have to post that often, but consistency matters more than perfection. Tools like [hypefury](https://hypefury.com/) can help you schedule posts ahead of time. The key is to show up regularly.

## 3. Get Better at Copywriting

This changed everything for me. I took [Sam Parr's copywriting course](https://copythat.com/) just 30 minutes a day for a week. Now I keep my favorite writing samples in a Claude project and reference them when I'm writing something important. Small improvements in how you communicate can make a huge difference in how your content lands.

## 4. Build a Voice-to-Content Pipeline

The struggle most people have with creating content is that it takes too much time. But it doesn't have to if you build the right systems, especially with AI.

Getting this system right takes some upfront work, but the payoff is enormous. Start by installing a good voice-to-text app on your phone. I use either [Superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com/) or [VoicePal](https://voicepal.me/). is great for prompting you to elaborate with follow-up questions. These tools let me capture ideas at their best. That's usually when I'm walking outside or away from my computer.

The key is to carefully craft your first few pieces of content. These become examples for your prompts that teach AI your style and tone. Once you have high-quality examples, you can organize these (transcript, content) pairs and feed them to language models. The in-context learning creates remarkably aligned output that matches your writing style while maintaining the authenticity of your original thoughts.

For example, I used this pipeline at Answer AI. We regularly interview each other and turn those talks into blog posts. Our recent post about [SolveIt](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-11-07-solveit.html) shows how this approach works. The raw conversation is the foundation. Our workflow turns it into polished content.

I've also integrated this with my meeting workflow. Using [CircleBack](https://circleback.com/), my favorite AI note-taking app, I can automatically capture and process meeting discussions. You can set up workflows to send your meeting notes and transcripts to AI for processing. This turns conversations into content opportunities.

The real power comes from having all these pieces working together. Voice capture, AI, and automation makes content creation almost inevitable.

## 7. Write About What You See

Through my consulting work, I notice patterns that others miss. My most popular posts address common problems my clients had. When everyone's confused about a topic, especially in AI where there's lots of hype, clear explanations are gold. This is the motivation for some of my blog posts like:

- [Fuck You, Show Me The Prompt](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/prompt/)

- [Your AI Product Needs Evals](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/)

If you are building AI tools, you probably see patterns too. Maybe it's common questions from customers, or problems you've solved repeatedly. Share these insights! Your unique perspective is more valuable than you think.

## The Content Flywheel: Putting It All Together

Once you have these systems in place, something magical happens: content creates more content. Your blog posts spawn social media updates. Your conversations turn into newsletters. Your client solutions become case studies. Each piece of work feeds the next, creating a natural flywheel.

Don't try to sell too hard. Instead, share real insights and helpful information. Focus on being adding value and educating your audience. When you do this well, people will want to follow your work.

This journey is different for everyone. These are just the patterns I've seen work in my consulting practice and my own growth. Try what feels right. Adjust what doesn't. Most importantly, be yourself.
