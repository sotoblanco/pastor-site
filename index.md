## Welcome To Hamel's Webpage

I'm a data scientist specializing in Machine Learning.  Lately, I have been working on NLP problems using deep learning to learn representations from code and text at [Github](https://github.com/).  Prior to this, I worked as a data scientist in growth marketing at [Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/data/home), and before that I helped build [Automated Machine Learning](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/current-state-automated-machine-learning.html) technologies at [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/).
