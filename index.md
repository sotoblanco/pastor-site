## Welcome To Hamel's Professional Page

I'm a data scientist specializing in Machine Learning.  The purpose of this page is to serve as a central point of reference for talks and blogs I write. 


### Open-Source Projects

- [Machine Learning Ops](https://mlops-github.com/), A collection of resources on how to facilitate Machine Learning Ops with GitHub.

- [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform for Jupyter Notebooks.

- [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet), Datasets, tools, and benchmarks for representation learning of code. 

- [Issue Label Bot](https://github.com/machine-learning-apps/Issue-Label-Bot), A GitHub App powered by machine learning.

- [Semantic Code Search](https://github.com/hamelsmu/code_search), Semantic search of code through learning a joint embedding of natural language and code. (This work was further refined in [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet)).
