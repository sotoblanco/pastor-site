## Welcome To Hamel's Professional Page

I'm a data scientist specializing in Machine Learning.  Lately, I have been working on NLP problems using deep learning to learn representations from code and text at Github.  Prior to this, I worked as a data scientist in growth marketing at Airbnb, and before that I helped build Automated Machine Learning technologies at DataRobot.  Before that, I was a management consultant for ~8 years.

The purpose of this page is to serve as a central point of reference for talks and blogs I write.  Furthermore, any materials that I reference in my talks will be made available here.
