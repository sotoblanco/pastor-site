## Welcome To Hamel's Professional Page

I'm a data scientist at GitHub specializing in Machine Learning infrastructure and developer tools.  I have previously held ML roles at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) and [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/), as well as a long stint in management consulting.

I have created many data-science flavored [integrations with GitHub products](https://github.blog/author/hamelsmu/). Furthermore, I am currently a core developer for [fastai](https://github.com/fastai).  

In the recent past, I have contributed to data infrastructure/tools such as [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/code-intelligence), [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action), and [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations_action).

### Open-Source Projects

- I maintain and contribute to a variety of [fastai](https://github.com/fastai) projects.   Recently, I've been involved with the following projects: [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev), [fastcore](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore), [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), [ghapi](https://github.com/fastai/ghapi)

- [Machine Learning Ops](https://mlops-github.com/), A collection of resources on how to facilitate Machine Learning Ops with GitHub.

- Creator of [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform for Jupyter Notebooks.

- [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet), Datasets, tools, and benchmarks for representation learning of code.  This was a follow up project to [Semantic Code Search](https://github.com/hamelsmu/code_search).

- [Issue Label Bot](https://github.com/machine-learning-apps/Issue-Label-Bot), A GitHub App powered by machine learning.
