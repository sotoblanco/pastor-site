title: Open Source
---

I love working on OSS projects, particularly those that are related to developer tools and infrastructure. 

I've contributed to a large variety of open source projects, such as [fastai](#fastai), [Metaflow](#metaflow), [Kubeflow](#kubeflow), [Jupyter](#jupyter), and [Great Expectations](#great-expectations), as well as [many others](#other-tools).  I list some of these projects below.


## fastai ![](img_oss/fastai_small.png){width="10%"}

I maintain and contribute to a variety of [fastai](https://github.com/fastai) projects. Below are the projects I've been very involved in:

## Metaflow ![](img_oss/metaflow.webp){width="7%"}

I created [notebook cards](https://github.com/outerbounds/metaflow-card-notebook): A tool that allows you to use notebooks to generate reports, visualizations and diagnostics in Metaflow production workflows. [Blog](https://outerbounds.com/blog/notebooks-in-production-with-metaflow/)

## Kubeflow ![](img_oss/kubeflow.jpeg){width="10%"}

I've worked on several projects related to Kubeflow, mainly around examples and documentation:

Project | Description | Role | Other References |
-- | -- | -- | -- |
[GitHub Issue Summarization](https://github.com/kubeflow/examples#github-issue-summarization) | An end-to-end example of using Kubeflow to summarize GitHub Issues.  Became one of the most popular tutorials of Kubeflow. | Author | [Interview with Jeremy Lewi](https://youtu.be/VTGH9ocdVM0)

The [Kubeflow Blog](https://github.com/kubeflow/blog) | I used fastpages to create the official Kubeflow blog. | Core Contributor | [Site](https://blog.kubeflow.org/)


## Jupyter ![](img_oss/jupyter.png){width="7%"}

I created the [Repo2Docker GitHub Action](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action), which allows you to trigger [repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker) to build a Jupyter enabled Docker images from your GitHub repository.  This Action allows you to pre-cache images for your own [BinderHub cluster](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zero-to-binderhub/setup-binderhub.html) or for [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).

This project was accepted into the official JupyterHub GitHub org.

## Great Expectations ![](img_oss/ge.png){width="20%"}

I developed the [Great Expectations GitHub Action](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations_action) that allows you to use Great Expectations in CI/CD Workflows. [Blog](https://github.blog/2020-10-01-keeping-your-data-pipelines-healthy-with-the-great-expectations-github-action/).


## Other <i class="bi bi-github"></i>

I worked as a staff machine learning engineer at GitHub from 2017 - 2022.  I led or created the following open source projects that explored the intersection of machine learning, data and the developer workflow:
