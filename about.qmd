I'm a Machine Learning Engineer who loves building data-science infrastructure  and developer tools 👷🏼‍♂️.  I've recently caught the entrepreneurship bug and am building something new with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/).  I have previously held related roles at Airbnb, DataRobot, and GitHub, as well as a long stint in management consulting.

I'm very active with open source projects. I've [listed my projects here](opensource.qmd). 

## 💼 Consulting

I actively do consulting projects to fund my open source work.  DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamelhusain/) describing the problem you need help with if interested.

## 💻 Professional History
