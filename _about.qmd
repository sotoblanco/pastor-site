I'm a Machine Learning Engineer who loves building data-science infrastructure and developer tools 👷🏼‍♂️.  I've recently caught the entrepreneurship bug and am incubating something new.  I have previously held related roles at Airbnb, DataRobot, and GitHub, as well as a long stint in management consulting.

:::

I am a core developer for [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/). I've also contributed to many open source ML tools, which [I've listed here](opensource.qmd).

## 💼 Get In Touch

Do you need help operationalizing machine learning, or with any of the [open source projects](opensource.qmd) I'm involved with?  I'm open to consulting work and other forms of advisory. Email me at `hamel.husain@gmail.com` if you'd like to chat!
